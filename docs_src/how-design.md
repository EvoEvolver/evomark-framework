[Distill](https://distill.pub/) is a very good website which make knowledge of machine learning very accessible by amazing interactive figures. The goal of Evomark is not providing interactive figures as elegant as the articles on Distill. Rather, Evomark aims to provide a tool that the authors can use daily and to increase the interactivity of their writing with very less overhead.

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is another awesome Markdown-like language whose functions overlaps a lot with Evomark. The motivation of Evomark is to make another step toward the goal of R Markdown by completely embrace the Javascript Eco-system. Evomark also aims to provide a more readable source code format than R Markdown. 

[ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/) is a website that makes every article on arXiv into HTML. In a lot of cases, it works as well as Evomark on imitating LaTeX. It will be better if the authors can spend more time on styles.
